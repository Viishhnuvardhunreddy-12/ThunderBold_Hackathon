Rainfall Pattern Prediction

📌 Problem Statement

Build a machine learning model to predict rainfall in Indian cities using historical weather data.
This project aims to analyze weather patterns and accurately forecast whether it will rain tomorrow. The insights can assist farmers, policymakers, and industries in making informed decisions about agriculture, resource management, and disaster preparedness.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

Data Handling → Pandas, NumPy

Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Machine Learning → Multiple Model(Logistic regression,Decision Tree ,Random Forest)

Model Evaluation → Accuracy Score, F1_Score, Precision, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

⚙ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Viishhnuvardhunreddy-12/ThunderBold_Hackathon.git
cd rainfall-pattern-prediction

2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

3️⃣ Run the Notebook
jupyter notebook Rainfall_Prediction_Model_mavricks.ipynb

🚀 Usage

Load the dataset 

Run all cells in the notebook.

The notebook will:

Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)

Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Evaluate models using accuracy,F1_Score,Precision, confusion matrix, and classification report


📊 Sample Output

Accuracy comparison of ML models


Normalized confusion matrices

Feature importance plots

Visualizations of rainfall trends across Indian cities
